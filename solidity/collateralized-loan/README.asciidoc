= Introduction 

This project is inspired by Udacity's capstone project of the course Blockchain with Solidity: https://github.com/udacity/cd13282-blockchain-with-solidity-project

WIP: not yet finished / fully implemented.

== Collateralized Loan 

The idea is quite simple:

 * users make a loan request by depositing some collateral and specifying: 
 ** amount requested
 ** duration 
 ** interest rate 
 * users can browse open loan requests and decide to accept a loan request
 ** the money will be deposited in the requester's account 
 ** a loan entry will be created 
 ** the collateral will be held until the loan is repaid 
 

Platform specific items: 

 * max LTV of 75%
 * loan will be paid back if LTV exceeds 85%
 * fees:
 ** loan request fee paid by borrower: 1% of loan amount
 ** settlement fee paid by borrower if a loan is accepted: 1% of loan amount

It's a proof of concept implementation so more advanced features like being able to use your collateral across multiple loans won't be implemented just yet.
